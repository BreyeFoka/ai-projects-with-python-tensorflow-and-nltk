This project is an implementation of a recommendation system using user-based collaborative filtering. It utilizes the MovieLens dataset to build a user-item matrix and then finds similar movies using the NearestNeighbors algorithm.

## Important Features

- Utilizes user-based collaborative filtering
- Uses the NearestNeighbors algorithm for finding similar movies
- Built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the MovieLens dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
